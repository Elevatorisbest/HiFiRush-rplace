This was a template for template-manager script for TamperMonkey that allowed anyone on r/place to place HiFi Rush (specifically 808) more efficiently.

These were the steps to use it:

1. Open up the menu of the template manager ![Picture of the button](https://i.imgur.com/i6K9VVi.png)

2. In the "Template URL" box, paste in this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elevatorisbest/hifirush808rplace/main/overlay.json

4. Then, click always load and the template should be displayed for 808.

5. Precise link to the final resting place of 808 was this: (https://reddit.app.link/place?cx=-798&cy=392&px=12&screenmode=fullscreen) (as of 25.07.2023 23:26 CEST)
